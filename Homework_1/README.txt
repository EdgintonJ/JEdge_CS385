I chose this site from another site that had awards for WebGL websites. 
I chose this in in perticular because I actually race motorcycles myself and so I 
was interested in seeing how a bike would be modeled in WebGL.

The 2 things that stick out to be the most (in the bike showcase towards the bottom) is the feeling of depth and the lighting.
In terms of depth, the parts on the bike don't seem flat (like a jpeg just glued onto a cube). Even the tire tread has depth to it,
which is a very minute detail. 
The lighting though... is something else, especially the reflecting. Ignoring the crappy shadow and no reflection in the mirrors,
the gloss on the bike looks good (and there's even transparency on the brake fluid resorvior). 

I do feel like though that if i zoom in I will start to see the cracks (and not because of the artist). 
It does run really smooth though...

You know what... forget everything I said, I just noticed the bodywork is a 1-sided material... which is not the fault of the program but 
rather the artist/modeler. We were this close to perfection...
